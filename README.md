# Assignment

#### 1.Implement the below equation using TensorFlow 1.x version, run the
#### forward propagation and save the model.
#### Output = x + 1 / 2x^2 â€“ 4
#### where x is the input tensor of size 2x3.


#### 2. Given an input image of size 28x28x1, build a CNN model with two
#### layers of convolution along with ReLU, flatten and dense layers. The first
#### convolution layer has 64 hidden layers with kernel filter size of 3.
#### Similarly, the second convolution layer has 32 hidden layers with kernel
#### filter size of 3. The output of the network has shape 10 on which softmax
#### is applied. Build the above model using TensorFlow version 1.x, run
#### forward propagation and save the model.
